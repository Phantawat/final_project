# In Evaluation step:
      When you login as faculty and you're an advisor, your display will show the project detail
    and ask you for evaluating the project. In evaluation step you will have to set the project status
    to be evaluating then the project information (all keys in project table) will pop-up to your display.
    After you've evaluated. the display will ask you to approve or no.
    
        In term of coding. we're going to create evaluate function to call project table from name
    and show it in the terminal. In this function will ask you to approve. after that database will be
    updated.
